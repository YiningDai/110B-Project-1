# 110B-Project-1 Sudoku Solver
The project show how optimization works in games like Sudoku. It perfectly fits the framework of linear programming, but with integer constraint. For now, we already have learned the Lagrange multipliers for equality constraints, but this project has additional inequality constraints. To experience all data in files, you only need to change “2”in for w in range(2) to len(data).
# Compile/Run the code
One can run the code by downloading some test data sets. The test data sets are divided into three categories:
Public small data set A (your group can verify your algorithms on this data set to see if your method works or not),  Public large data set B (your group can run your algorithms on this data set to report the performance of the algorithms), Private data set C (after submission of your code, your work will be tested on a small data set with various difficulty levels).
# Contributors
This project is based on previous projects by Yimin Zhong, which show how optimization works in games like Sudoku. In addition, this project is written with the help from "Optimization using simulated annealing" by  SP Brooks and BJT Morgan.
